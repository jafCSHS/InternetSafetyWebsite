						<h1>Dangerous Links</h1>

						<p>
							The internet has become a vast and dangerous place, and while
							there are many websites which are safe to use, there are also many
							which will try to cause you harm.
						</p>
						<p>
							Many links will pretend to be a different website than they
							actually are, and will try to steal your information. This is
							called phishing, and is a very common way for people to steal your
							information. More information on phishing can be found on our
							other article
							<a href="/learn/phishing.html">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are also websites which only monitor the user's actions,
							which are less direct, but can still cause the user to lose
							important information.
						</p>

						<h2>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2>
						<p>
							Sometimes, a malicious device will attempt to go between you and
							the website you are trying to access in a way that makes the link
							look correct. This is very hard to detect when a website uses
							http, but if it uses HTTPS, then the website will not load if it
							is being manipulated unless you manually switch it to http.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having an HTTPS lock can help ensure the safety of a website. This
							is visible as a green lock next to the URL of the website. This
							means that data transfer to and from the website is encrypted, and
							is much safer than a website without the lock. It is important to
							note that this only signifies that the website is coming from the
							url it says it is, and does not necessarily mean that the website
							is safe to use. Always check the URL to make sure it is the
							correct one.
						</p>

						<h2>Common Signs of a Compromised Link</h2>
						<p>Some common ways to check for a dangerous link include:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Many websites will have a URL which is similar to the website
								they are trying to impersonate, but not quite the same. For
								example, a website which is trying to impersonate Google may
								have a URL such as https://www.g00gle.com, which is very similar
								to the real Google website, but is not the same. Always check
								the URL to make sure it is the correct one.
							</li>
							<li>
								Having an incorrect TLD (Top Level Domain) and/or SLD (Second
								Level Domain). For example, a website which is trying to
								impersonate Google may have a URL such as
								https://www.google.com.fake.com, which is very similar to the
								real Google website, but is not the same. In reality, you are
								accessing the "google" subdomain on the fake.com website. Always
								check the URL to make sure it is the correct one.
							</li>
							<li>
								Using characters which look similar to other characters. For
								example, a website may use the œÅ character instead of the p
								character, which looks very similar in order to trick the user
								into thinking it is the correct website. Always check the URL
								carefully to make sure it is the correct one.
							</li>
