						<h1>Phishing</h1>

						<p>
							At first thought, one may think that phishing is the act of
							catching fish with a rod. But in reality, phishing is a type of
							cyberattack, used to steal a user's data (for example: credit card
							information and login details)
						</p>

						<h2>But how do they work?</h2>

						<p>
							Phishing attacks are carried out by cybercriminals who send
							malicious emails to a wide range of people. These emails are
							designed to look like they are from a legitimate source, such as a
							bank or a trusted company. The email will ask the recipient to
							click on a link or download an attachment. If they do, they will
							be taken to a fake website that looks like the real thing. The
							website will then ask them to enter their personal information,
							such as their username and password. Once they do, the cyber
							criminals will have access to their account.
						</p>

						<h2>What are the components of a phishing attack?</h2>

						<p>
							Phishing attacks are made up of three main components: the email,
							the website, and the cybercriminal.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The email is the first part of the attack. Pretexting is when
								the email contains a story or context to make the link more
								believable. It is designed to look like it is from a legitimate
								source, such as a bank or a trusted company. The email will ask
								the recipient to click on a link or download an attachment.
							</li>
							<li>
								The website is the second part of the attack. The website will
								look like the real thing, but it will be a fake website designed
								to steal the user's information. The website will ask them to
								enter their personal information, such as their username and
								password. Once they do, the cyber criminals will have access to
								their account.
							</li>
							<li>
								The cybercriminal is the third part of the attack. They are the
								ones who send the email and create the fake website. They are
								also the ones who will have access to the user's account once
								they enter their information.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>How can I avoid phishing attacks?</h2>

						<p>
							There are a few ways to avoid phishing attacks. First, you should
							always be wary of emails that ask you to click on a link or
							download an attachment. If you are not sure if an email is
							legitimate, you should contact the company directly to verify that
							it is real. You should also make sure that you have a strong
							password for all of your accounts. This will make it harder for
							cyber criminals to access your accounts. To learn more about
							suspicious links, check out our article on
							<a href="dangerousLinks.html">Suspicious Links</a>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Never give out your personal information online without checking
							first. Ensure that whereever you are putting your information is
							who they say they are and that they are a trusted source. If you
							are unsure, do not give out your information and contact the
							company through official means.
