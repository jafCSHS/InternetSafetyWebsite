						<h1>Password Safety</h1>
						<p>
							Password safety is a very important subject in the modern world.
							Passwords are used for everything from Bank details to Netflix
							accounts. Since most people do not wish to remember so many
							different passwords for all their accounts, they tend to use the
							same few passwords for everything. This is very dangerous.
						</p>

						<h2>Keeping Your Information Safe</h2>
						<p>
							There are many ways to keep your to keep your information safe
							just by changing how you use passwords.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Change your password occasionally: Changing your password every
								once in a while can reduce the risk that your account is
								compromised. If you change your password every 3 months, then if
								someone gets your password, they will only have access to your
								account for 3 months. Although it may not make sense to change
								all your passwords every three months, it is a good idea to
								change your password for your imporant accounts every 3 months.
							</li>
							<li>
								Have a different password for every account: While this can be
								tedious to remember, it is the safest method. If one account is
								compromised, the others will be safe. The tediousness can be
								eliminated by using a password manager, which will allow you to
								remember 1 very safe password, which is stored only on your
								computer, and the manager will remember the rest.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use randomly generated passwords: Randomly generated passwords
								are much harder to guess than passwords that are based on words.
								This is because when using words, people tend to use common
								words, or words that have a personal meaning to them. Randomly
								generated passwords are much harder to guess, and are much
								safer. It is also easier to include special characters in
								randomly generated passwords, which makes them even harder to
								guess.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Alternate Forms of Authentication</h2>

						<h3>Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
						<p>
							One of the most common forms of alternate authentication is
							two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is a method
							of confirming a user's claimed identity by utilizing a combination
							of two different components. Two factor authentication is a type
							of multi-factor authentication. A good example of two-factor
							authentication is when you log into a website, and after entering
							your password, you are sent a code to your phone, which you enter
							to confirm your identity. This is a very secure method of
							authentication, as it requires both your password and your phone
							to log in.
						</p>

						<h3>Biometrics</h3>
						<p>
							Another form of authentication is biometrics. Biometrics is the
							technical term for body measurements and calculations. It refers
							to metrics related to human characteristics. Biometrics
							authentication is used in computer science as a form of
							identification and access control. This is a very secure method
							that utilizes a person's unique characteristics, for example,
							their fingerprint or face, in order to authenticate them.
						</p>

						<h3>Passkeys</h3>
						<p>
							There is also a new technique that is becoming more readily
							available: passkeys.
						</p>
						<p>
							A new login method called passkeys will be introduced in 2023 to
							address phishing and password reuse problems.
						</p>
						<p>
							A passkey is some randomly generated data, usually 100-1400 bytes
							in size, created on your personal device (e.g., phone, laptop,
							security key) for logging in to a specific website.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once generated, the passkey is securely stored and associated with
							the website by your browser, often in your password manager.
							Instead of entering a password, you can use the passkey to log in
							to that website. On the login page, you will have the option to
							"Sign in with a passkey." Selecting this option will prompt your
							password manager to confirm, and once confirmed, you will be
							logged in.
						</p>
						<p>
							Multiple passkeys can be created, with each granting access to a
							single account on a specific website. If you have multiple
							accounts on the same website (e.g., personal and business social
							media accounts), you can use different passkeys for each account.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each passkey is linked to a domain name, indicating the website it
							was created for. If someone sends you a link to a deceptive domain
							name's login page, your browser will not be deceived. Browsers can
							easily verify an exact match and will not transmit the passkey to
							a similar-looking domain name, ensuring your security.
